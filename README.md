# Performing-Bitwise-Operation-on-Images-Using-OpenCV
Performing bitwise operation on images is very useful when working with masks. Bitwise operators such as AND, OR, NOT and XOR are the available operations in OpenCV library. This operators works in a way that object positions in an image can be changed
